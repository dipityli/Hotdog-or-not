# Hotdog-or-not
This classifier is inspired by Jian Yang's app, 'seefood'. It can differentiate between a hotdog and something that is not a hotdog.

I will sadly not be able to provide the dataset for this project because I had scraped it from the internet and the images I had used might be copyrighted
